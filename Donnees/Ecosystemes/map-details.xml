         <Functional_group>F1.1 Permanent upland streams</Functional_group>
         <Description>Freshwater ecoregions  (Abell et al. 2008) were initially identified as containing permanent upland streams if: i) their descriptions mentioned features consistent with those identifed in the profile of the Ecosystem Functional Group; and ii) if their location was consistent with the ecological drivers described in the profile. The selected ecoregions were then clipped to exlude cold or dry climates (mean temperature of coldest quarter &gt;0°C, mean annual preipitation &gt;300mm) based on data from Karger et al. (2017). Major occurrences were mapped by intersecting the selected ecoregions with the distribution of 1st-3rd order streams taken from the RiverATLAS (v1.0) database at 30 arc seconds spatial resolution (Linke et al. 2019). The remaining areas within selected ecoregions (excluding freeze/thaw areas) were designated as minor occurrences.</Description>

         <Description>The indicative map of Intertidal forests and shrublands (MFT1.2) was developed by resampling the known global distribution of mangrove forests for the year 2000 mapped by Giri et al. (2011). We used a buffer of 1km around the distribution data and a 30 arc second grid, thus large aggregations (&gt; 1km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) are depicted as major occurrences, and the buffer areas with small occurrences are shown as minor occurrences. The original high-resolution data is available at [UNEP-WCMC](http://data.unep-wcmc.org/datasets/4).</Description>

         <Functional_group>T2.5 Temperate pyric humid forests</Functional_group>
         <Description>Remote sensing estimates of canopy height were used as a direct indicator of the distribution of this group of tall forest ecosystems  (Armston et al. 2015, Hao et al. 2019). We selected all areas with tree canopies taller than 40m, and clipped to the spatial extent of temperate climate types (Beck et al. 2018). Mapped occurrences were then aggregated to half degree spatial resolution and reclassified as major occurrences (&gt;20% of cell area) and minor occurrences (&lt; 20% of cell area).</Description>

Further areas with mixed occurrence of barren and snow/ice cover were identified from the Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map (Raynolds et al. 2019), the USGS EROS LandCover GLCCDB, version 2 (Loveland et al. 2000) and a 1km consensus land-cover map (Tuanmu et al. 2014). A composite map was created at 30 arc seconds spatial resolution in geographic projection, occurrences were then aggregated to half degree cells.  Cells containing at least one known location were designated as major occurrences, while those mapped as mixed barren and snow/ice cover were designated as minor occurrences if snow/ice covered at least 2.5% of the cell area.</Description>
